    <h3>Program 1</h3>
    <p>
        The climbing season on Mount Everest typically occurs during May, 
        when weather conditions are most favorable. During this time, 
        temperatures can range from -60°C (-76°F) at night to 0°C (32°F) 
        during the day. The mountain experiences severe weather conditions, 
        including hurricane-force winds and sudden storms.

    <h3>Program 2</h3>
    <p>
        The journey to Everest's summit typically takes about two months in total. 
        This includes establishing various camps along the route and allowing time 
        for acclimatization. Climbers must pass through the infamous Khumbu Icefall, 
        considered one of the most dangerous stages of the climb due to its unstable nature.
    </p>

    <h3>Program 3</h3>
    <p>
        The first successful ascent of Mount Everest was achieved on May 29, 1953, 
        by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Since then, the mountain has seen 
        over 4,000 successful climbs. Despite modern technology and equipment, 
        Everest remains one of the world's most challenging and dangerous climbs, 
        with over 300 people having lost their lives on its slopes since the first 
        recorded deaths in 1922.

                Mount Everest, at 8,848.86 meters tall,
                 is the highest mountain in the world,
                  formed by the collision of tectonic plates.

        <h3>Program 4</h3>
        <p>
            Mount Everest's ecosystem is unique and fragile. The mountain hosts several 
            species adapted to extreme conditions, including the Himalayan tahr, snow 
            leopard, and various bird species that can fly at high altitudes. The plant 
            life is equally remarkable, with species like the Himalayan blue poppy found 
            at elevations up to 6,000 meters (19,685 feet).

            The base camps of Everest serve as crucial staging points for climbers. 
            The South Base Camp in Nepal (5,364m/17,598ft) and North Base Camp in 
            Tibet (5,150m/16,900ft) are small communities during climbing season, 
            complete with medical facilities, communication systems, and support staff. 
            These camps have become legendary in mountaineering culture.

        <h3>Program 6</h3>
        <p>
            Modern climbing on Everest faces new challenges and controversies. The 
            commercialization of expeditions, overcrowding on popular routes, and 
            the impact of climate change are major concerns. The melting of glaciers 
            is exposing frozen bodies and decades of accumulated waste, while also 
            creating new hazards for climbers through unstable ice formations.

                        The mountaineer shares that at first,
                         climbing Everest seemed unreal, but as they ascended,
                          each step became a battle against the cold, lack of oxygen, and exhaustion.
                           Upon reaching the summit, they felt that all the effort was worth it,
                            not just for the view, but for the personal victory. 
                            It was a reminder that the greatest battles are internal.

                        The mountaineer describes the ascent of Everest as the greatest
                         challenge and most rewarding experience of their life.
                         As they climbed, the air became thinner and the cold more intense.
                          Despite moments of despair and storms, reaching the summit
                           brought a sense of peace and the feeling of being close to the sky,
                            an experience that changed their life forever.

                    <p>
                        A mountaineer describes their ascent of Everest as an extreme physical and mental challenge. Although the training and acclimatization were intense, nothing prepares you for the effort of reaching the summit.
                         The view from the top is indescribable, but there’s also a sense of respect for the mountain’s
                          dangers. Upon reaching the summit, there’s a mix of joy, relief, and admiration for the magnitude
                           of nature.
